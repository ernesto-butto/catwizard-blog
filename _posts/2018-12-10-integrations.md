## Thank you Integration, for relieving the pain

My wife and I came out of the dentist office. She went for a check-in but they had to operate, she ended up drugged, and disoriented.

"Make sure she takes this drug in the next hour or so, else the pain will bring her to tears once the sedative wears off, there is a pharmacy right in front of the building, but you know, lately patients have told me the drug is hard to find"

It was a sunny day in Caracas, Venezuela, and the drug was a common one, but our political and economic situation was starting to be uncommon. We went to the pharmacy, no luck, then to the next one... same luck... none! 

Time was running out when she grabbed me by the arm while I was driving, and told me... "Use the web page we developed for god's sake!! It's starting to hurt!!"... Riiiight, I had forgotten about that one...

## The sacredness of time, your most important resource

Man is ill-equipped to manage time, however, time is the most important resource in your life, and in your business. Traditionally, business theory teaches us that there are 3 types of resources: Capital, People and Time. Let's break it down:

### Capital

> Time is also a unique resource. Of the other major resources, money is actually quite plentiful. We long ago should have learned that it is the demand for capital, rather than the supply thereof, which sets the limit to economic growth and activity

*Source: [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459)
 by Peter F. Drucker*

### People

> And regarding people, we can always hire people, even though good people are hard to find.

### Time

But for time, no matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it, and it can't be stored in any way. Yesterday time is gone and it will never come back.

On top of that, everything requires time, it is the true and only universal condition. All work takes time, uses time, requires time.

> ... Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable, and necessary resource. Nothing else, perhaps, distinguishes effective executives as much as their tender loving care of time.

![Time]({{ "/assets/images/time.jpg"}})

Yes, the best executives in the world go to great lengths to learn how to save their time, so they can use where it matters most, where it makes a difference.

There is, however, a magic artifact that comes in many forms that has repeatly been tested and creates pockets of times, so we can store it, save it, re-use it.

It has evolved throught the centuries, from ancient times, and today it's precent in many forms. Systmes, rules, automations, information flow.

"But I already have systems in the business" you might say... "in fact we have many. And man, what a complication it is! It's overwhelming!"

But ask your self, are your systems working together ? are they **team** players or individualists? Are they designed to **collaborate and to create a better system (eco-system)** for everyone? or are they wasting lots of your time? Do they help you to provide the service expected by today's standards?

The design and successful implementation of integrations create a wealth of time. Just in time information converts into fast service, and less worry.

> A man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone
>
> -— HENRY DAVID THOREAU

But! Just as a drug, systems can do wonders if prescribed correctly, and wreak havoc if applied incorrectly. Take your time to understand the design.

Designing these collaborations is not an easy task, and it's becoming mandatory for survival, I hope this article saves you time, your most valuable resource, and points you in the right direction.

Before we go deeper, I want to give you 2 tips that I hope make a difference for you. If you keep these tips in mind in your process then I can die in peace, my work is done in this world. It's amazing the impact of these 2 and how few organizations do them:

- **Tip 1: Test Before You Implement**. Yes, do some mockups, or prototypes. They can be done in Google Slides, Invision, or a piece of paper, and put users to the test. This will save you money and time in a huge way, it will help you estimate much better the scope, the development will be in a fraction of the time, and your end product will be many times better. It can save you years!!

- **Tip 2: Calculate your Return Of Investment:** Measure your time wasters before and after. Hey, let's focus on the objective, time is money and both can be measured. Doing an integration project have Tangible Benefits, such as *time reduction in tasks*, and Intangible benefits such as *ability to offer improved customer service and support*. Focus on Measuring tangible measures.

Return of investment on correctly implemented system integrations are HUGE, and measuring them is necessary to enable the success of the project, justify future developments, and ensure that your organization gets value for your money. [See this guide for tools and spreadsheets to get you started](https://www.axia-consulting.co.uk/html/basic_roi_calculation.html)

*“Every business is a software business”* said Watts S. Humphrey, the father of quality in software and CMMI 2 decades ago, and it's **repeated by The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella** today:

*“Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating as a digital company. It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one. It’s not about one simple software solution. It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.”*

## What do P.I.M, S.A.P, Zapier and B.I have in common

In short, they are all tools to centralize the data across different systems and creating meaningful views from them. Useful, time-saving, smile givers, decision empowering, wealth builders information in human format. Here are some formal concepts:

| BI  | Business Intelligence           | Delivers relative and reliable information at the right people, at the right **time**, **using methods and programs to collect and structure data**, and presents it in a meaningful and actionable way.  |
| MDM | Master Data Management          | Master Data is the consistent and uniform set of identifiers and extended attributes that **describes the core entities of the enterprise** including customers, prospects, citizens, supplier, sites, hierarchies and chart of accounts |
| PIM | Product Information Management  |  Manages the information required to market and sell products through distribution channels. **A central set of product data** can be used to feed information to media such as websites, print catalogs, ERP systems, and electronic data feeds to trading partners.     |
| Zapier |   | Easy automation for busy people. Zapier **moves info between your web apps automatically**, so you can focus on your most important work.    |

This are a few examples of critical systems, but can you see the common denominator? I see Time and Integration everywhere.

Combining your current systems can achieve more than you can imagine, in most cases more than acquiring new systems. Don't believe me? ask most legacy banks in the world in what language do they run their core... Does *Cobol* rings a bell? well it shouldn't, Cobol is one old piece of technology, no longer taught in most computer science careers, but a scary size of the financial transactions of the world runs on top of it, [around 80%!](https://devops.com/cobol-completely-obsolete-omnipresent-language/).

However, combine Cobol with newer tech like mobile apps, and it creates powerful experiences.

## Our first and simple Integrations Exp

 > The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what's going on so they can do a lot more than they've done in the past. 
 >
 > —BILL GATES, co-founder of Microsoft

About 8 years ago, we were asked to estimate, develop and implement a module to our in-house made web software, an online web catalog system (yes the one at the intro!), so it would integrate with the accounting systems of all the stores and provide one unified view of product information.

Farmaplus is a pharmacy, and the motivation behind the online system was to save customers time, by giving them price and availability information based on inventory rotation with a 10 to 15 minutes delay, providing them with better service vs the 24 hours delay of the competition back then. 

It saved time to customers, to employees, gave useful information to laboratories, helped managers and gave a piece of mind to stakeholders.

Over time, and while the scarcity of medicines and other products increased, this channel transformed the business making it the priority over the conventional printed catalog, became a sales focus point, helped a lot of people including myself to find their medicine, and was responsible for giving meaning and direction to our team and the evolution of that software

Years after we internationalized we kept working on integrations, connecting nationals and internationals companies with all kinds of systems: CRM's such as Salesforce, commercial websites, quoting systems, Shopify implementations, accounting systems,  warehouses, health clubs, and more.

## Market Facts: Systems Integrations, an increasing focal point for businesses

> "It is your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your destiny." 
>
> -- Tony Robbins

Making the decision at the right time define our reality... But for making a good enough decision, we need key information, at the right time.

- "Where are you going bro?", I asked my brother some years back as I watched him getting ready to party!
- "My company is throwing a party, it's going to be a sick man!"
- "Awesome! what are you guys celebrating?"
- "It appears that after 3 years and millions of dollars, our company finally integrated systems from different departments! Everyone is very excited!"

Yeah... brace yourself, bro, it's going to get geeky. Market and SKU geeky.

![Pim Forrester 2018]({{ "/assets/images/pim_forrester.png"}})

Last year, I did months of market research around product information and integration software. We had created a system over the years that solved many integrations issues. We decided to create a business plan for evaluation and see how far could we take it, thus I talked to a lot of software vendors, following the white rabbit into a deep rabbit hole.

[Source: 2018-forrester-wave-product-information-management](https://www.enterworks.com/pim/enterworks-leads-2018-forrester-wave-product-information-management/)

Here are some facts I pulled out from the research that might hopefully prompt you to take some kind of action:

- By 2015, 64% percent of adults in the USA **buy online because the products presented there have more precise information than in stores.*** *- Source: Forrester 2016: Product Information Management Solutions, Q4 2016*. This strategy seems to work, according to [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/topics/2477/online-shopping-behavior/), retail e-commerce sales worldwide are forecast to nearly double between 2016 and 2020.

- **Experiences in the B2C world increase B2B purchases**, almost 75% say that buying from a web page is more convenient than buying to sales representatives when they buy products or services for work. *-Source: PIM Is A Cornerstone Of Your Digital Business Why Customer-Obsessed Firms Need Product Information Management January 18, 2017*

- [InRiver](https://www.inriver.com/), one of the leading PIM vendors, claims that they have an **annual growth rate (CAGR) of %70**. I did check other vendors data, and all of them have grown big time.

- **87% of data leaders and analysts implemented or are planning to implement or expand on PIM** (Software Integration for Products). Why? Managing spreadsheet and separated systems is not sustainable. To save time, minimize errors, increase the time to market, and manage constantly changing requirements content for allies, digital business need automated checks *- Source: Vendor Landscape: Product Information Management (PIM), Q3 2017*

- In 2015, %67 of decision makers related to infrastructure said that develop a complete strategy in the cloud was a high or critical priority. **Additionally %56 projected an increase on investment in cloud services by the end of 2015.** *- Source: The Forrester WaveTM: Master Data Management, Q1 2016*

## A Summarized Checklist for Software integration

Now, before feeling overwhelmed about the challenge at hand, know this.

*You can reap the benefits of integrations, of becoming "digital" one small step at the time. You do not need to invest in a 3-year project now, just commit to 3 months, do a small integration, enjoy the returns of your investment, and afterward put the next brick.*

Slowly but uninterrupted. This is a much faster way to become digital, it creates a habit around development, and habits my friend bring on tangible results.

**Tip**: **Aim for effectiveness**. What is the one question that if answered faster would solve many problems at once, for the most people in the company? Identify and focus on that one, do not try to take on 10 unarticulated data problems. You won't solve them, you will create a 7 head beast that will breathe down your neck every night at bedtime, it will waste money, team effort, and most important, waste tons of Time.

Being **effective** is about doing the right things while being **efficient** is about doing things right. Don't be efficient about things that don't matter.

Yes, a clear vision of the end goal is the most important part, luckily we can rely more on processes to accomplish this, and less in mindfulness meditation.

I believe in processes and methods, in lists and frameworks. This is a simplified checklist of what I consider a very challenging part in software integration. Creating a clear end goal in mind, and modeling the data from the different systems to meet the goal, are both challenging parts of the process.

With the purpose of keeping this post relatively short, I created a separate post to talk about this subject in detail. The following is a quick list to give you an idea if it interests you can find more content and references in [PART 2 of this post]()

1. Design and test a prototype/mockup: Having the end goal clear.
2. Measure before and after: Ensure value for your money
3. Modeling Data: Identify Data Entities
4. Choosing the Architecture: Centralized Vs Virtualized
5. Identify Source Systems: Where is my data?
6. Choose The Matching Strategy: How to tie it all together.

Whatever we choose to develop a tailored system, or customized an off-the-shelf-solution, these steps are common to both approaches.

## Finding the middle ground: Custom vs Off The Shelf Software

> “The vision always precedes and itself determines the realization.”
> 
> -- Lillian Whiting

As you can see in the previous steps, you need to understand why are you doing the integration, identify what data to use, from which systems, and figure out how to merge them together.

I recommend to Re-use what is working, use third-party for specific and tested solutions like CRM or E-commerce, and customize the part of your eco-system that ties everything together, that makes you unique... The integration core, the business core.

You don't want to invest in a year project, with a complete re-write or replace of a system, experience major downtime and potential errors, just to have the same system you had before.

**Word of caution:** Vendors are usually interested in selling their software. Most commercial offers from the companies that I talked to for P.I.M software do not include the integration itself to the systems in the company, they redirect you to integrators that they know, who at the end of the day, are going to be the more important role than the systems you are buying.

And they will not tell you this clearly but at the very end of the selling process. At first is all "yes, yes, do not worry, this is what the package is worth, these are the yearly fees, and with that, your problems will be solved, etc...".

There are several vendors out there, but last time I checked, very few offered key on hand solutions and the ones that do serve the Enterprise segment.

## Jhipster: A Recommended Custom Development Technology

We have developed a lot of system integrations, and if I had to choose today what technology to use for your custom solution, I recommend [Jhipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/). After years of consultancy and tons of custom development, I find this platform the most productive and incredibly robust.

The main benefit of our experience are:

- Reliable
- Quality
- Speed
- Maintainable
- Flexible
- Secure
- Economic

 In short, a big time saver, with a huge B and humongous I and unmistakable G. BIG time.

Jhipster generates Spring Code at the back end. [Spring](https://spring.io/) is the de-facto standard in Enterprise Java, it has been around for at least 16 years, some define it as the source for modern java. It's reliable, tested and has a huge community, incredibly active, of enterprise developers.

For the front end, there is all sort of options: Angular, React and I saw a Vue.js plugging at their marketplace recently. There are also mobile hybrid generators for both Angular and React tech.

![using jhipster]({{ "/assets/images/jhipster_logos.png"}})

*[and many more](https://www.jhipster.tech/companies-using-jhipster/)*

Think of it as a magic weapon, you need enough level to use it, but when used correctly it generates enterprise quality for a fraction of the costs. You can integrate technologies that usually would take weeks to integrate, in moments, allowing smaller companies to enjoy the benefits of enterprise technology.

Developers using the framework also increase their level considerably, since the generated code follows certified best practices, and the tool encourages you to generate a lot of code to save time, developers learn by example.

Here are some of the features:

- Incredible fast code generation with many options depending on your needs
- A development profile for fast front and backend development
- A Production profile ready setup (optimized and tested).
- Generates ready to use API and documentation for web and mobile apps as you code
- Generation of automated tests for both backend and frontend
- Quality code analyzer with sonar cloud, to maintain the project secure and easy to maintain
- SQL, and no SQL databases options such as Oracle, Mysql, Postgre, MongoDB, Casandra, Couchbase
- Allows API-First development, code generation, and documentation
- Cache options for enhancing performance such as Ehcache, Hazelcast, Infinispan, Memcached
- Enterprise-ready Spring Security, out of the box, with users and roles predefined.
- Out of the box enterprise search features, such as entity filtering and elastic search.
- WebSockets integration for real-time communication
- Option to generate Microservices Architecture code generation for big scalable projects.
