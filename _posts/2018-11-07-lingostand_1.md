LingoStand mission is to help users attain communication level in a new language as quickly as posible, and later to accelerate their current level specializing in a particular topic or area of interest.

The first course helps the user to learn the meaning and usage of the most used words in a language on its real context.

Of all the millions of words on a language, you only need to understand a small set to be able to communicate and learn how to use them in real life.

Native speakers with a low education level do not know a big set of words. But they only need a small group of words to be able to communicate. If you go surfing in Venezuela, you need only to speak with native fishermen, and you can communicate using a small word set.

It's been proven multiple times that to learn faster, is better for you to use content that you are really interested in, because you will come back to practice with more often, with real intention and interest. For this reason, we are constantly updating our library with new trending articles as well as classic books and stories.

We are constantly re-inventing our interface and technology around these goals.
