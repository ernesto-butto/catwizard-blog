## NOTA PARA LA PROXIMA:


## Systems help! My wife needs her fix!
My wife and I came out of the dentist office. She went for a check-in but they had to operate, she ended up druged, and desoriented.

"Make sure she takes this drug in the next hour or so, else the pain will bring her to tears once the sedative wears off, there is a pharmacy right in front of the building, but you know, lately patient have told me the drug is hard to find"

The drug was a common one, but our political and in consequence economical situation was starting to be uncommon. We went to the pharmacy, no luck, then to the next one... same luck... none! 

Time was running out, and then she grabed me and told me... "Use the web page we developed for god's sake!! It's starting to hurt!!"... Riiiight, I had forgotten about that one...

## The sacredness of time

Man is ill equiped to manage time, however, time is the most important resource in your life, and in your business. Traditionally, business theory teaches us that there are 3 types of resources: Capital, People and Time. Let's break it down:

**Capital**
> Time is also a unique resource. Of the other major resources, money is actually quite plentiful.We long ago should have learned that it is the demand for capital, rather than the supply thereof, which sets the limit to economic growth and activity

*Source: [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459)
 by Peter F. Drucker*

**People**

> And regarding people, we can always hire people, even though good people are hard to find.

**Time**

But for time, no matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it, and it can't be stored in any way. Yesterday time is gone and it will never come back.

On top of that, everything requires time, it is the true and only universal condition. All work takes time, uses time, requires time. 

> ... Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable, and necessary resource. Nothing else, perhaps, distinguishes effective executives as much as their tender loving care of time.

Yes, the best executives in the world go to great lenghts to learn how to save their time, so they can use when it matter most, where it makes a difference. 

However, there is a way to use systems to create pockets of time for everyone in the business. For the customer, employee, provider, manager, stakeholder, and for the most important person of all, for you... 

What is the way? You might ask, well this one you heard before... Systems. 

"But I already have systems in the business" you might say... "in fact we have many. And man, what a complication it is! It's overwhelming!"

But ask your selef, are your systems working together ? are they **team** players or individualists? Are they designed to **collaborate and to create a better system** for everyone or are they wastin lot's of your time? Do they help you to provide the service expected by today's standards?

The design and succesful implementation of integrations create wealths of time. Just in time information converts into fast service, and less worry.

But! Just as a drug, systems can do wonders if prescribed correctly, and wreack havocks if applied incorrectly. Take your time to understand the design. 

Designing these collaborations is not an easy task, and it's becoming mandatory for survival, I hope this article saves you time, your must valuable resource, and points you into the right direction.

Before we go deeper, I want to give you 2 tips that I hope make a difference for you. If you keep these tips in mind in your process then I can die in piece, my work is done in this world. It's amazing the impact of these 2 and how few organizations do them:

- Tip 1: Test Befor You Implement. Yes, do some mockups, or prototypes. They can be done in Google Slides, Invision, or a piece of paper, and put users to the test. This will save you money and time in a huge way, it will help you estimate much better the scope, the develompent will be in a fraction of the time, and your end product will be many times better. It can save you years!!

- Tip 2: Calculcate your Return Of Investment: Measure your time wasters before and after. Hey, let's focus on the objective, time is money and both can be mesured. Doing an integration project have Tangible Benefits, such as *time reduction in tasks*, and Intangible benefits such as *ability to offer improved customer service and support*. Focus on Measuring the tangible measures. 

Return of investment on correctly implemented system integrations are HUGE, and measuring them is necesary to enable the success of the project, justify future developments, and ensure that your organization get's value for your money. (See this guide for tools and spreadsheets to get you started)[https://www.axia-consulting.co.uk/html/basic_roi_calculation.html]

> “Every business is a software business”
said Watts S. Humphrey, the father of quality in software and CMMI 2 decades ago, and it's repeated by The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella today: 

> “Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company. It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one. It’s not about one simple software solution. It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.”

## Different faces of system integrations

Business Intellegence (B.I.),  Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP (Think SAP software), Product Information Management (P.I.M), Master Data Management (M.D.M), even Zappier, are all faces of the same montain, they all promise to gather data, centralize it, and turn it into useful informatino, and to have it ready for you when you need it most.

Now, before feeling overwhelmed about the challange, know this.

**You can reap the benefits of integrations, one step at the time.** You do not need to invest in a 3 year project now, just commit to 3 months, do a small integration, enjoy the returns of your investment, and afterwards put the next brick. 

Slow but un-interrupted. This is a much faster way then it looks like, and it creates a habit, and habits my friend shape reality.

**Tip**: Aim for effectiveness. What is the one question that if answered faster would solved many problems at once, for the most people in the compay? Identify and focus on that one, do not try to take on 10 inarticulated data problems. You won't solve them, you will create a 7 head beast that will breath to your neck every night at bed time, it will waste money, team effort, and most important, waste tons of Time.

Combining your current systems can achieve more then you can imagine, in most cases more then aquiring new systems. Don't believe me? ask most legacy banks in the world in what language do they run their fundations... Does Kobol rings a bell? well it shouldn't, Kobol is one old piece of technology, no longer teached in most computer science careers, but a scary size of the financing systems of the world runs on top of it. 

## Our first and simple Integrations Exp
About 8 years ago, we were asked to estimate, develop and implement a module to our in-house made web software, an online web catalog system (yes the on at the intro!), so it would integrate with the accounting systems of all the stores and provide one unified view of product information.

![farmaplus]({{ "/assets/images/integrations_1/farmaplus_2.png"}})
(List of physical stores, green menas available, yellow there are a few left, red means not available)

Farmaplus is a pharmacy, and the motivation behind the online system was to save customers time, by giving them price and availability information based on inventory rotation with a 10 to 15 minutes delay, providing them with better service vs the 24 hours delay of the competition back then. 

It saved time to customers, to employess, gave useful information to laboratories, helped managers and gave piece of mind to stake holders.

Over time, and while the scarcity of medicines and other products increased, this channel transformed the buisiness making it the priority over the conventional printed catalog, became a sales focus point, helped a lot of people including myself to find their medicine, and was responsible for giving meaning and direction to our team and the evolution of that software

Years after we internotialized we kept working on integrations, connecting nationals and internationals companies eith all kinds of systems: CRM's such as saleforce, commercial websites, quoting systems, shopify implementations, accounting systems,  warehouses, health clubs, and more.

## Market Facts: Systems Integrations, an increasing focus point for buisinesses

> "It is your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your destiny." - Tony Robbins

Making the decision at the right time define our reality... But for making a good enough decision, we need key information, at the right time.

- "Where are you going bro?", I asked my brother some years back as I watched him getting ready to paarrtyy!
- "My company is throwing a party, it's going to be sick man!"
- "Awesome! what are you guys celebrating?"
- "It appears that after 3 years and millions of dollars, our company finally integrated sytems from different departaments! Everyone is very excited!"

Yeah... brace yourself bro, it's going to get geeky. Market and SKU geeky.

Last year, I did months of market research around product information and integration software. We had created a system over the years that solved many integrations issues. We decided to create a business plan for evaluation and se how far could we take it, thus I talked to a lot of software vendors, following the white rabbit into a deep rabit hole.

Here are some facts I pulled out from the research that might hopefully prompt you to take some kind of action:

1- By 2015, 64% percent of adults in the USA buy online because the products presented there have more precise information than in stores. (Source: Forrester 2016: Product Information Management Solutions, Q4 2016). This strategy seems to work, according to [statista.com](https://www.statista.com/topics/2477/online-shopping-behavior/), retail e-commerce sales worldwide are forecast to nearly double between 2016 and 2020.

2- InRiver, one of the many integration software vendors, claims that they have an annual growth rate (CAGR) of %70. I did check other vendors data, and all of them have growned big time.

3- 87% of data liders and analysts implemented or are planing to implement or expand on PIM (Software Integration for Products). Why? Managing spreadsheet and separated systems is not sustainable. To save time, minimize errors, increase time to market, and manage constantly changing requirements content for allies, digital business need automated checks (Source: Vendor Landscape: Product Information Management (PIM), Q3 2017)

4- In 2015, %67 of desicion makers related to infraestructure said that develop a complete strategy in the cloud was a high or critical priority. Additionally %56 projected an increase on investment in cloud services by the en of 2015. (Source: The Forrester WaveTM: Master Data Management, Q1 2016)

5- Experiences in the B2C world increase B2B purchases, almost 75% say that buying from a web page is more convenient than buying to sales representatives when they buy products or services for work. (Source: PIM Is A Cornerstone Of Your Digital Business Why Customer-Obsessed Firms Need Product Information Management January 18, 2017)

## What do P.I.M, M.D.M and B.I have in common?

In short, they are all tools to centralize the data accross different systems and creating meaningfull views from them. Useful, time saving, smile givers, decision empowering, wealth builders, information in view format.

| MDM | Master Data Management          | Master Data is the consistent and uniform set of identifiers and extended attributes that describes the core entities of the enterprise including customers, prospects, citizens, supplier, sites, hierarchies and chart of accounts |
| PIM | Product Information Management  | Central set of product data can be used to feed information to media (Website, catalogs, ERP, feeds)                                                                                                                         |
| BI  | Business Intelligence           | Delivers relative and reliable information at the right people, at the right time, using methods and programs to collect and structure data, and presents it in a meaningful and actionable way.                             |

## A Summarized Checklist for Software integration

Design wise, and in my opinion, this are the key desicions:

1. Design and test a prototype/mockup
2. Measure your 
2. Modeling Data: Identify Entities
3. Choosing the Architecture: Centralized Vs Virtualized 
4. Identify Source Systems
5. Choose The Matching Strategy


Following is a general guide to systems integrations, and the techonology I would use to create a custom integration system. There are tons of technologies to accomplish this, some are general like an ERP system, some very specific for a domain, for example PIM integrates information around a product. 

If you are going to integrate information about hospital for example, then a different system specialized for hopsitals can be used or develop.

My intentions is to create a general solutions so most readers can understand the general process... at least how we have approached it.

### What you do is more important then how you do it
[SHOW SIMPLE MAP OF BEGINING AND END]
The first step of the process is to have a clear view of the end result, and test it. Yes, test it even in the most simple way posible, this means putting a fake mockup infront of your user and see if it works.

Create some simple mockups and screens with the ideas. Invision is a wonderful tool for this, but microsoft presentation would do.

Create something that is real enough to have the feel of the interaction of the main tasks, and no, you don't need a designer for this, it's a fake, like movie setup.

We like to use Google's Venture Spring Process [ADD LINK] because is a proven profesional process, but sometimes you only need to do some mockups on a white board, iterate over that and that will create a mockup good enough.

With the screen views in place and tested a little, you should have a view of the main screens of your system integration. You are now ready to start modeling your data

### Visual Overview Of the End Process
Here is a simplified view of integrated systems life cycle:

1. Frequently load data from **sources**
2. Constantly match sources data to **master data**
3. Show information in **end users views**.

[2 IMAGES, PROCESS AND END VIEWS]

**sources** are anywhere the data is store. They can be systems, databases, spreadsheets, datawharehouses, etc...
**master data** are identifier that tie id's from other systems togethers, such as product SKU, customer id, invoice numbers. Also called Master Record
**end users views** are the views you created in the previews steps, the mockups. This is what the user interacts with.

Now that we know what we want, we need to model the data to accomplish the integration.

### 1. Modeling Data: Identify Entities

The first step is to identify the entities that you need to integrate, so you can accomplish the end views.

Think of entities as nouns in the system, some examples: 
- Customer, SalesPerson (who?) 
- Product, Service (what?)
- Quote, Order (why?)
- Location (where?)
- Invoice (How?)

You will probably need mixed views from every entity, after that, we can go to the next step and choose the architecture.

### 2. Choosing Architcture: Centralized Vs Virtualized

[Slide of Choosing MDM Model: Centralized Vs Virtualized]

Should we create data structures to save temporaly information from the systems? Or should we reuse the information directly from the sources and create a virtual layer?

To be honest, we have always used the Centralized approach. Mostly because almost always we need some field to make sense of the data, for example to recomend products between them, to save a reference of a document produced by the centrilized system, for historical purposes (e.g. generated quote id), are a few examples.

### 3. Identify Source Systems

Now, we need to identify the sources, CRM, In-Store sales, warehouses, supply chain, finance, marketing... 

The central model will create a super set of data, where websites, mobile apps, and other applications can reference the "Golden Record"

Ideally, this central aplication will provide an API, a set of commands to comunicate directly with the centralized data once, as opposed to communicat to the original sources one by one.

### 4. Matching Strategy

This is a fundamental part of your integration. If your matching strategy is not realistic, then all of your investment will be lost! 

Matching is the process of crossing the records of different systems and tying them into the one record, and identified as equivalent. So if it's left half way, the system won't be useful

Ideally, we select an automatic matching rule, and then we let humans check review them and fix them.

**Step 1. Unique fields matching rules**
Rules to be added so the system can check and automatically match records from both systems. For example email or social security number for people, SKU's for products, or combinations of fields such as (last name + date of birth)

We can add a list of rules for the system to check, and if match is found then create an automatic match.

**Step 2. Fuzzy Matching**
For recommending matching strings such as names, product names and addresses where human error or different entry standards between systems can cause slight variations in similar values eg: “Joe Smith” vs “J Smith”.

Match scores are created between each fuzzy logic match, for example, using this [Java library](https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy), it would be somehitng like

`FuzzySearch.ratio("mysmilarstring","myawfullysimilarstirng")= 72`

`FuzzySearch.ratio("mysmilarstring","mysimilarstring") = 97`

And the rule could be `if ratio > 85` then do a match.

**Step 3. Matching Approval: Key Role**
Ideally you would have 2 kind of review:

1- By someone internally
2- By end users

Both should have a way to comunicate a mismatch if found.

**Step 4. Remember to allow manual matching**
Finally, your system should be able to allow manual matching, to address exceptional cases.

### 5. Master Records

Once a matching has been applied to the records, an internal reference table is maintained with the unique ids of the matching entities of the systems and a Master ID that holds the reference of both systems.

Data administrator will have the ability review and un-match between systems if necessary.

### 6. Survivorship fields

In general, this concept refers to defining the attributes or fields to be used from each system.

## What techonology to use. Custom Made vs Third Party Vendors

I do not have a straight answer for this, I can only give my opinion

Vendors are usually interested in selling their software and what you need, which is the guidance and of what to integrate, most commercial offers from the companies that I talked to for P.I.M software do not include the integration itself, they redirect you to integrators that they know.

And they will tell you this clearly at the very end of the selling process. At first is all "yes, yes, do not worry"

There are several vendors out there, but last time I checked, very few where key on hand solutions, and the ones that do serve the Enterprise sector.

Based on our experience this is our proposed Techonology Stack and Development Methodology

## Taylored Technology Stack

I recommend development with Jhipster. I'm developing software since before I started Engineering. After years of consultancy and tons of custom development, I find this platform incredible robust and productive. 

Think of it like a magic wepon, you need enough level to use it, but when used correctly it generates enterprise quality for a fraction of the costs. You can integrate techonologies that usually would take weeks to integrate. Here are some of the features:

- Ready to use API for web and mobile apps
- Powerfull cross attributes database search (Elastic search)
- Production ready code (optimized and tested)
- Generation of Quality Assurance Tests
- Sql, and no Sql databases
- Microservices support
- Auto generated interactive documentation (swagger)

The main benefit is a combination of relaibility, quality, speed and flexability. In short, saving time.

Companies that use it? From Adobe, to Decathlon, USA Defense department, many banks like, etc....(see jhipster webpage)
