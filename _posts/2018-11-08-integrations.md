## A back story
My wife and I came out of the dentist office. She went for a check-in but ended up druged, operated, and desoriented.

"Make sure she takes this drug in the next hour or so, else the pain will bring her to tears once the sedative wears off, there is a pharmacy right in front of the building, but you know, lately patient have told me the drug is hard to find"

The drug was a common one, but our political situation was starting to be uncommon. We went to the pharmacy, no luck, then to the next one... same luck. 

Time is running out... "Use the web page we developed for god's sake!! It's starting to hurt!!"... Riiiight, I had forgot about that one.

## Developing Integrations Exp
About 8 years ago, we were asked to estimate, develop and implement a module to our in-house made web product catalog system so it would integrate with ours customers inventory systems, they have a bunch of stores all over my home city, Caracas - Venezuela. 

They are a pharmacy, and the motivation behind the online system was to save customers time and money, by giving them price and availability information with a 20 minutes delay providing them with better service vs the 24 hours delay of the competition back then. 

Over time, and while the scarcity of medicines and other products increased, this channel transformed the buisiness making it the priority over the conventional printed catalog, helped a lot of people including myself to find their medicine, and was responsible for giving meaning and direction to our team and the evolution of that software

We ended up integrating warehouse information from international companies, and doing consulting for integrating information for health clubs.

The integration problem is not a new one, it's always been there. You have information in different systems about users, products and other entities, and they are in seperate system across the company.

"Hello sir! We will provide the information in a few days, the information about stock is in the warehouse accounting system, the new arrivals in the purchasing, and your quote will have to be handled by X. Will inform you as soon as we can"

This service was ok a few years back, but todays users, both consumers and B2B, expect faster responses, expect Amazon service, they want the information, and they want it now, to make their desicion, which needs to be made this morning, and they need it accurate.

On-time information is simply more valuable then ever.

Integration between systems to provide unified views is a common problem that traditionally only enterprises were able to address: to be able to provide an unified view of information that is usually scattered across systems. 

## SaaS Complexity and small buisiness
