<h2 id="the-sacredness-of-time">The sacredness of time</h2>

<p>Man is ill equiped to manage time, however, time is the most important resource in your life, and in your business.</p>

<p><strong>Capital resource</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We long ago should have learned that it is the demand for capital, rather than the supply thereof, which sets the limit to economic growth and activity</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Source: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459">The Effective Executive</a>
 by Peter F. Drucker</em></p>

<p><strong>Human resource</strong></p>

<p>And regarding people, we can always hire people, even though good people are hard to find.</p>

<p><strong>But Time! Time is unique!</strong></p>

<p>But for time, no matter how high the demand, the supply will not go up. There is no price for it, and it can’t be stored in any way. Yesterday time is gone and it will never come back.</p>

<p>On top of that, everything requires time, it is the true and only universal condition. All work takes time, uses time, requires time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Yet most people take for granted this unique, irreplaceable, and necessary resource. Nothing else, perhaps, distinguishes effective executives as much as their tender loving care of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the best executives in the world go to great lenghts to learn how to save their time, so they can use it matter most, where it makes a difference.</p>

<p>However, there is a way to use systems to create pockets of time for everyone in the business, for every customer, employee, provider, manager, stakeholder… And the way is to integrate their data, to provide beutiful and useful information.</p>

<p>This way man can do a miracle. To save time, to be wealthier, happier, productive… but we have to learn how to use such power, so we can use it to serve us.</p>

<p><em>“Every business is a software business”</em> said Watts S. Humphrey, the father of quality in software and CMMI 2 decades ago, and it’s repeated by The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Every company is a software company. You have to start thinking and operating like a digital company. It’s no longer just about procuring one solution and deploying one. It’s not about one simple software solution. It’s really you yourself thinking of your own future as a digital company.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this article, I hope I can at least set you in the right path.</p>

<h2 id="different-faces-of-system-integrations">Different faces of system integrations</h2>

<p>Business Intellegence (B.I.),  Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP (Think SAP software), Product Information Management (P.I.M), Master Data Management (M.D.M), even Zappier, are all faces of the same beast, they all promise to gather data, centralize it, and turn it into useful, on time information.</p>

<p>However these sytems require human cleverness and creativity for them to be useful in your situation.</p>

<p>Just as a powerful drug, systems can do wonders if prescribed correctly, and wreack havocks if applied incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="a-back-story">A back story</h2>
<p>My wife and I came out of the dentist office. She went for a check-in but they had to operate, she ended up druged, and desoriented.</p>

<p>“Make sure she takes this drug in the next hour or so, else the pain will bring her to tears once the sedative wears off, there is a pharmacy right in front of the building, but you know, lately patient have told me the drug is hard to find”</p>

<p>The drug was a common one, but our political and in consequence economical situation was starting to be uncommon. We went to the pharmacy, no luck, then to the next one… same luck… none!</p>

<p>Time was running out, and then she grabed me and told me… “Use the web page we developed for god’s sake!! It’s starting to hurt!!”… Riiiight, I had forgotten about that one…</p>

<h2 id="our-first-integrations-exp">Our first Integrations Exp</h2>
<p>About 8 years ago, we were asked to estimate, develop and implement a module to our in-house made web software, an online web catalog system, so it would integrate with ours customers accounting systems, so users could get inventory information, pricing and marketing information such as the product picture on one screen… they have a bunch of stores all over my home city, Caracas - Venezuela, and each physical store had their own accounting system.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/integrations_1/farmaplus_2.png" alt="farmaplus" />
(List of physical stores, green menas available, yellow there are a few left, red means not available)</p>

<p>Farmaplus is a pharmacy, and the motivation behind the online system was to save customers time, by giving them price and availability information based on inventory rotation with a 10 to 15 minutes delay, providing them with better service vs the 24 hours delay of the competition back then.</p>

<p>It saved time to customers, to employess, gave useful information to laboratories, helped managers and gave piece of mind to stake holders.</p>

<p>Over time, and while the scarcity of medicines and other products increased, this channel transformed the buisiness making it the priority over the conventional printed catalog, became a sales focus point, helped a lot of people including myself to find their medicine, and was responsible for giving meaning and direction to our team and the evolution of that software</p>

<p>Years after we internotialized we kept working on integrations, connecting nationals and internationals companies eith all kinds of systems: CRM’s such as saleforce, commercial websites, quoting systems, shopify implementations, accounting systems,  warehouses, health clubs, and more.</p>

<h2 id="systems-integrations-an-increasing-focus-point-for-buisinesses">Systems Integrations, an increasing focus point for buisinesses</h2>

<p>Decisions shape our reality, it creates our conditions, and that of our buisiness.</p>

<p>Making the decision at the right time define our lives. But for making a good enough decision, we need key information, not all information! Just the right one, at the right time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Where are you going bro?”, I asked my brother some years back as I watched him getting ready to paarrtyy!</li>
  <li>“My company is throwing a party, it’s going to be sick man!”</li>
  <li>“Awesome! what are you guys celebrating?”</li>
  <li>“It appears that after 3 years and millions of dollars, our company finally integrated sytems from different departaments! Everyone is very excited!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah… brace yourself bro, it’s going to get geeky. Market and SKU geeky.</p>

<p>Last year, I did months of market research around product information and integration software. We had created a system over the years that solved many integrations issues. We decided to create a business plan for evaluation and se how far could we take it, thus I talked to a lot of software vendors, following the white rabbit into a deep rabit hole.</p>

<p>Here are some facts I pulled out from the research that might hopefully prompt you to take some kind of action:</p>

<p>1- By 2015, 64% percent of adults in the USA buy online because the products presented there have more precise information than in stores. (Source: Forrester 2016: Product Information Management Solutions, Q4 2016). This strategy seems to work, according to <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2477/online-shopping-behavior/">statista.com</a>, retail e-commerce sales worldwide are forecast to nearly double between 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p>2- InRiver, one of the many integration software vendors, claims that they have an annual growth rate (CAGR) of %70. I did check other vendors data, and all of them have growned big time.</p>

<p>3- 87% of data liders and analysts implemented or are planing to implement or expand on PIM (Software Integration for Products). Why? Managing spreadsheet and separated systems is not sustainable. To save time, minimize errors, increase time to market, and manage constantly changing requirements content for allies, digital business need automated checks (Source: Vendor Landscape: Product Information Management (PIM), Q3 2017)</p>

<p>4- In 2015, %67 of desicion makers related to infraestructure said that develop a complete strategy in the cloud was a high or critical priority. Additionally %56 projected an increase on investment in cloud services by the en of 2015. (Source: The Forrester WaveTM: Master Data Management, Q1 2016)</p>

<p>5- Experiences in the B2C world increase B2B purchases, almost 75% say that buying from a web page is more convenient than buying to sales representatives when they buy products or services for work. (Source: PIM Is A Cornerstone Of Your Digital Business Why Customer-Obsessed Firms Need Product Information Management January 18, 2017)</p>

<h2 id="amazon-raised-the-bar-for-b2b-and-b2c">Amazon raised the bar, for B2B and B2C</h2>

<p>“Hello sir! Thank you for your quote request, we will give you an answer about your quote in a few days…” Yes, <strong>in a few days</strong>, they have to make a few calls inside and outside the company to give the number.</p>

<p>This kind of service was ok a few years back, but todays users have a different standard, both consumers and B2B expect faster responses. To achieve this using organization is not enough, automation is required.</p>

<p>Amazon raised the bar, Enterprises started to invest in this integration sytems 5 years ago, all users want the information <strong>now</strong>, to make their desicion, they need the information, and they need accurate information.</p>

<p>On-time information is simply more valuable then ever. It will define you as a service provider. A customer can make a desicion now to choose you if they have the information, and will choose the one who can give it to them sooner, even if you got better prices and other conditions, if the information is late your customer might have already decided.</p>

<p>Integration between systems to provide unified views is a common problem that only traditionally enterprises were able to address: to be able to provide an unified view of information that is usually scattered across systems.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-not-only-for-enterprises-small-and-medium-business-need-a-strategy">This is not only for enterprises, small and medium business need a strategy</h2>

<p>Now days a new software model is already stablished, one that 10 years ago was unimaginable. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted by another company.</p>

<p>Support, product updates, year licence, installations… all of this required a big budget to implement, now in your hands for $49,99</p>

<p>Think gmail or any other email provider for business. You get an awesome and otherwise very expensive product and service for a monthly fee, and you don’t have to worry about updates, hardware, maintainance, etc… Some examples of what a company might choose:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Freshbooks for accounting</li>
  <li>Salesforce as a CRM</li>
  <li>Shopify for web ecommerce</li>
  <li>MailChimp for marketing</li>
  <li>Wordpress for the webpage</li>
  <li>Cisco Webex for video meetings</li>
</ul>

<p>This list grows and goes to different segments according to your industry. Gym Owner? Maybe you have something like VirtuaGym. Learning a language? maybe you are paying a monthly fee to memrise.</p>

<p>But, as a small buisiness grows, and grows on top of different SaaS software, the typycal problem of integration arises. You’re users demand better service, better service means better information, and to do that you need to integrate it. You have offcourse some systems that are now SaaS and in the cloud.</p>

<p>And you have some systems that are traditionally inside your company. You already got that working, and the investment payed out a long time ago…</p>

<p>In short, they are all tools to centralize the data accross different systems and creating meaningfull views from them. Useful, time saving, smile givers, decision empowering, wealth builders, information in view format.</p>

<h2 id="a-summarized-checklist-for-software-integration">A Summarized Checklist for Software integration</h2>

<p>This a general guide to systems integrations, and the techonology I would use to create a custom integration system. There are tons of technologies to accomplish this, some are general like an ERP system, some very specific for a domain, for example PIM integrates information around a product.</p>

<p>If you are going to integrate information about hospital for example, then a different system specialized for hopsitals can be used or develop.</p>

<p>My intentions is to create a general solutions so most readers can understand the general process… at least how we have approached it.</p>

<p>This fuide is a modified version of a more techinical guide created by <a href="https://es.slideshare.net/Dataversity/lessons-in-data-modeling-data-modeling-mdm">Industry Expert Donna Burbank</a>. Thank you Donna for helping us grow!</p>

<h3 id="start-with-the-end-views-in-mind">Start with the end views in mind</h3>
<p>[SHOW SIMPLE MAP OF BEGINING AND END]
The first step of the process is to have a clear view of the end result, and test it. Yes, test it even in the most simple way posible, this means putting a fake mockup infront of your user and see if it works.</p>

<p>Create some simple mockups and screens with the ideas. Invision is a wonderful tool for this, but microsoft presentation would do.</p>

<p>Create something that is real enough to have the feel of the interaction of the main tasks, and no, you don’t need a designer for this, it’s a fake, like movie setup.</p>

<p>We like to use Google’s Venture Spring Process [ADD LINK], but sometimes you only need to do some mockups on a white board, iterate over that and that will create a mockup good enough.</p>

<p>With the screen views in place and tested a little, you should have a view of the main screens of your system integration. You are now ready to start modeling your data</p>

<h3 id="visual-overview-of-the-end-process">Visual Overview Of the End Process</h3>
<p>Here is a simplified view of the process:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Frequently load data from <strong>sources</strong></li>
  <li>Constantly match sources data to <strong>master data</strong></li>
  <li>Show information in <strong>end users views</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>[2 IMAGES, PROCESS AND END VIEWS]</p>

<p><strong>sources</strong> are anywhere the data is store. They can be systems, databases, spreadsheets, datawharehouses, etc…
<strong>master data</strong> are identifier that tie id’s from other systems togethers, such as product SKU, customer id, invoice numbers. Also called Master Record
<strong>end users views</strong> are the views you created in the previews steps, the mockups. This is what the user interacts with.</p>

<p>Now that we know what we want, we need to model the data to accomplish the integration.</p>

<h3 id="1-modeling-data-identify-entities">1. Modeling Data: Identify Entities</h3>

<p>The first step is to identify the entities that you need to integrate, so you can accomplish the end views.</p>

<p>Think of entities as nouns in the system, some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customer, SalesPerson (who?)</li>
  <li>Product, Service (what?)</li>
  <li>Quote, Order (why?)</li>
  <li>Location (where?)</li>
  <li>Invoice (How?)</li>
</ul>

<p>You will probably need mixed views from every entity, after that, we can go to the next step and choose the architecture.</p>

<h3 id="2-choosing-architcture-centralized-vs-virtualized">2. Choosing Architcture: Centralized Vs Virtualized</h3>

<p>[Slide of Choosing MDM Model: Centralized Vs Virtualized]</p>

<p>Should we create data structures to save temporaly information from the systems? Or should we reuse the information directly from the sources and create a virtual layer?</p>

<p>To be honest, we have always used the Centralized approach. Mostly because almost always we need some field to make sense of the data, for example to recomend products between them, to save a reference of a document produced by the centrilized system, for historical purposes (e.g. generated quote id), are a few examples.</p>

<h3 id="3-identify-source-systems">3. Identify Source Systems</h3>

<p>Now, we need to identify the sources, CRM, In-Store sales, warehouses, supply chain, finance, marketing…</p>

<p>The central model will create a super set of data, where websites, mobile apps, and other applications can reference the “Golden Record”</p>

<p>Ideally, this central aplication will provide an API, a set of commands to comunicate directly with the centralized data once, as opposed to communicat to the original sources one by one.</p>

<h3 id="4-matching-strategy">4. Matching Strategy</h3>

<p>This is a fundamental part of your integration. If your matching strategy is not realistic, then all of your investment will be lost!</p>

<p>Matching is the process of crossing the records of different systems and tying them into the one record, and identified as equivalent. So if it’s left half way, the system won’t be useful</p>

<p>Ideally, we select an automatic matching rule, and then we let humans check review them and fix them.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. Unique fields matching rules</strong>
Rules to be added so the system can check and automatically match records from both systems. For example email or social security number for people, SKU’s for products, or combinations of fields such as (last name + date of birth)</p>

<p>We can add a list of rules for the system to check, and if match is found then create an automatic match.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2. Fuzzy Matching</strong>
For recommending matching strings such as names, product names and addresses where human error or different entry standards between systems can cause slight variations in similar values eg: “Joe Smith” vs “J Smith”.</p>

<p>Match scores are created between each fuzzy logic match, for example, using this <a href="https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy">Java library</a>, it would be somehitng like</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">FuzzySearch.ratio("mysmilarstring","myawfullysimilarstirng")= 72</code></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">FuzzySearch.ratio("mysmilarstring","mysimilarstring") = 97</code></p>

<p>And the rule could be <code class="highlighter-rouge">if ratio &gt; 85</code> then do a match.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3. Matching Approval: Key Role</strong>
Ideally you would have 2 kind of review:</p>

<p>1- By someone internally
2- By end users</p>

<p>Both should have a way to comunicate a mismatch if found.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. Remember to allow manual matching</strong>
Finally, your system should be able to allow manual matching, to address exceptional cases.</p>

<h3 id="5-master-records">5. Master Records</h3>

<p>Once a matching has been applied to the records, an internal reference table is maintained with the unique ids of the matching entities of the systems and a Master ID that holds the reference of both systems.</p>

<p>Data administrator will have the ability review and un-match between systems if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="6-survivorship-fields">6. Survivorship fields</h3>

<p>In general, this concept refers to defining the attributes or fields to be used from each system.</p>

<h2 id="what-techonology-to-use">What techonology to use</h2>
<p>I do not have a straight answer for this, I can only give my opinion.</p>

<p>There are several vendors out there, but last time I checked, very few where key on hand solutions, and none cheap since they usually serve the Enterprise sector. Business need to pay for the software, maintainence, and hours for dealing with your data and empowering employees.</p>

<p>Companies invest in their own technologies, and get it right, have huge returns and many times experience huge grow, and reuse the tech to move into other markets.</p>

<p>Based on our experience this is our proposed Techonology Stack and Development Methodology</p>

<h2 id="tech-time">Tech Time</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Jhipster</li>
  <li>Audits</li>
  <li>Elastic search</li>
  <li>Angular for the backend</li>
  <li>Hibrid technology such as Ionic/React for mobile</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="get-returns-fast-using-agile-and-prototyping">Get returns fast using Agile and prototyping</h2>

<h2 id="loose-pieces">Loose pieces</h2>
<h3 id="customers-demand-content">Customers Demand Content</h3>
<p>For this reason customers expect rich, relevant, continually updated content to help them through each step of the customer journey, regardless of purchase touchpoint.</p>

<h3 id="grow-market-share-through-fast-and-relevant-marketing">Grow Market Share through fast and relevant marketing</h3>
<p>It has been proven long ago that the way to grow your market share is with great customer experiences. Systems integrations allows</p>

<p>To grow market share with great customer
experiences, digital businesses must assess
their merchandising and product management
benchmarks and modernize their product
information management processes and
capabilities.</p>

<p>Find hidden opportunities in time to take action, correct unhealthy habbits, provide better service, be able to adapt to changes in an agile way.</p>
