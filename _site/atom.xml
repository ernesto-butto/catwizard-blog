Hopefully, it helps someone in some unforeseen way, worst case it helps me explore myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I have run a small Software Consulting Development company for years, but we are in transition to becoming an Independent Software development company or studio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m of course much more complex than a software developer tag, consultant, programmer, etc… just like you are much more complex than your professional tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also a book addict, specially self-help book addict, especially to practical books…  I really like testable information. Read, analyze, test, do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I like about software and self-help books is how both can change the current course of your life. For me, the code in both sources contains real magic, assuming they posses real value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can read a book, and if it’s the right book at the right time it can transform my life forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, I need to take the time to read it slowly, allowing the information to take a hold a little each day in me, like a plant you water and it slowly starts to grow, changing my thoughts, my believes, my habits and finally my circumstances. They can be a transformative experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking for example, man talk about a good investment!! I smoked a lot since I was 15 years old up to 36, and the few attempts I had made of quitting were pathetic. A few months and then I was back. After reading that book a bit each day, I developed a complete rejection for a cigarette. 2 years have passed and I can’t stand the smell of it, I respond to it like a non-smoker kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to fight a bad habit with willpower “one day at the time”, and another one entirely to re-write your programming to reject it not needing willpower at all. You just can’t stand the smell. What did the book say? What was the revolutionary message? Smoking is bad for you health, your economy, your self confidence… etc… I had offcourse heard the messages before, but it was written is such a way that if you consumed about 30 minutes each day of the book, by the end of it I really belived the message, it was part of my unconscious. At some point in the reading and then experimenting my life something clicked, I made a desicion, and from that instant I felt a rejection for cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another practical example is John Sarno’s Healing Back Pain book. I had a recurrent and very painful back spasms since 2012 until May 2017. Every 2 or 3 months my back got stiff, and every move in any direction was a world of pain. If I layed out and took anti-inflammatory medicine, in the course of a week I would be able to move again and pretend that nothing happened and I was ok. The first time I got it I was doing longboarding in Caracas and suddenly PAF… had to sit on the sidewalk and walk back home moving like a robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not want to go to the doctors, I was afraid they would give the pain a name and made the problem permanent. I’ve lost many outdoors activities buddies due to back pain diagnosis. Doctors do the best they can generally, but I learned through experience that an error in the diagnosis can condition and even create an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the book in May 2017 after a very shameful episode at the CrossFit box, again a few pages each day, and well, no more episodes until now (November 2018). Again, abut 30 minutes a day, my thoughs started to change, the pain started to change slowly, until one day I made a life desicion and started to act accordingly and the pain was gone (turns out having internal conflicts causes all kinds of physicall pains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on about all these books, and how they are continually shaping my life, but let’s focus on the main subject of this message: Meaning of Life. And for that, I’ll reference a book that contains something very special: Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said I favor tested practical content above theorists, and this one is tested in one of the most extreme environments ever produced in the history of mankind… Hitler’s concentration camps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the author (who was one of the prisoners) illustrated in crude hardcore HD that physically strong people had far less chance of survival than educated people who were able to give their life meaning baffled me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of how people, when lost meaning entered a recognizable state that inevitably leads to death, made me wonder for days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one of the most incredible lesson was, that the meaning in your life is something you have to give to yourself. You have to make it up, make your own story, or borrow someone else’s and adjust it, do what you need to do to fabricate your reason to be in the world and then believe it, really believe it. And if you do, you will have a clear goal, and lot’s of energy to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find solutions to problems, and grow stronger as your solve them. One thing I got from Victor Frankling is that those who had meaning not only survived the concentration camps, but they were able to have a full life afterwards. They did not turn to the dark side, but were able to have a good life themselves and contribute making the world better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense, I though, if you think about it. We are constantly making up stories to ourselves. Think about history’s highlighted characters, those that seem to have a driving force beyond human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take for example Magallanes and his crew, these guys actually did go around the world for the first time in history with equipments that shouldn’t have worked! First to America crossing the Atlantic, then discovered el canal de Magallanes mainly through believing that it existed without any proove, and then went and crossed the Pacific which was 3 times the lenght!! Compare them with todays astronauts that can pre plan the course… not taking anything out of our astronauts, I find them incredible, but they do have a bunch of thing estimated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not even important how big or important to others is this meaning, it only matters how big or important it is for you. Your world is what it’s really important. Viktor Frankl talked about people who’s meaning was taking care of their son, sharing time with his partner, or helping a friend that was in the camp. Others like Viktor were able to create more meaning, as a neurologist and psychiatrist, he saw himself comunicating the message of healing through meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, it is our job to find reasons to be excited about what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one note based on expirience: This thing works much better if the meaning is a responsible one. I used to think that responsability was the opposite of freedom, but what I realized with this book is that freedom is a wide concept that has 2 sides of an spectrum, in one side is selfishness and in the other responsability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ShowImage?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsability side is the one you can use as an element to create your meaning, the side that let’s you collaborate with what you have to give, transform your expiriences and your skills and put it at service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Viktor exemplifies how once meaning is lost, the persue of immediate pleasure takes over. This means extreme smoking, drugs, overeating, etc…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after going through all that I was like…. ok, how can I contribute? How can I find meaning? They say that questions will focus your attention into finding answers… Because finding meaning is something I definelty want in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is meaning? I would say, simply, something to live for, something to work for. A reason. For me it’s the story we make up ourself of &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; we are doing &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; we are doing. This &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; must be compelling enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a software professional I have felt a little of this in the past, I hope you have too. For example, in Venezuela we proposed and implemented an online system for some pharmacies so people could find medications. It updated inventory information from every branch of a city for each of their 7,500 product catalog. Back when we implemented it about 8 years ago, medical shortage was a big thing in Venezuela, and it’s worst each day. Now it’s a tragedy, just check it out for youself: [http://www.farmaplus.com.ve/#!/products].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That project made little profit, but back then it helped a lot of people, and some years afterwards when we ourselves needed the service urgently we were very happy to have built it. From all the projects we developed back then, that one I always remember with particular satisfaction, like we contributed. It is still used a lot daily by thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contrasting-this-with-other-more-profitable-projects&quot;&gt;Contrasting this with other more profitable projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have built other systems and work for different companies after that. We had an ecommerce project for women handbags in which users could pick a color and color it’s parts. Or another one where we helped cosmetic bottles and accesories distributors located in Miami, New Jersy and California to pick and quote cases of thousands of product using integrations to the wharehouses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both project where very interesting to make, however the feeling is not the same, knowing that what you made is helping people who really need it just give another meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what to do in these cases? A B2B distributor for example? Well we focused our meaning on how this features could make the employees lives of the people who worked in Businesses better, their employees, people we interacted with, people that worked with us in the projects. Once we focused our meaning on serving them then it was a fullfilling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-you-do-infintly-more-important-than-how-you-do-it&quot;&gt;What you do infintly more important than how you do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so this sentence I got from Tim Ferris and adopted it as a believe. We in the tech industry sometimes get so caught up on the perfect framework, the best methodology, the best language… Then we try to align our meaning to using this tools, and sometimes we can, but some times we force it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Industry teachs us that success is more about going viral, or having a good paying job, or nailing it as consultant with a high rate per hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as human need this too, we need to have the need of certainty fulfilled, that we are going to be able to pay our bills, help our families, eat, have a roof, etc… Beleive me as a traveling inmigrant that can’t return to his country because it’s in a very bad shape, I know how important this is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once you have a minimum certainty, meaning goes a long way, or as authous such as Viktor have demostrated, meaning will give you beyon human strenght&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns the main question that one would ask if you could go back in time and talk to these guys is Why? Why did you do all that? What motivated you? Well… each of them had different why’s different meanings. The stronger the meaning the more challanges were able to overcome. The stories of these guys makes the pirates of the caribean look boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it will power? No, will power is very limited. Unconsciuos is incredible powerful. And it al comes to the meaning, to the why, and we can give ourself this meaning by fabricating our own story. Isn’t that amazingly? I think it’s more incredible then most scifi or fantasy stories. And it’s real, and we all have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not even important how big or important to others is this meaning, it only matters how big or important it is for you. Your world is what it’s really important. Viktor Frankl talked about people who’s meaning was taking care of their son, sharing time with his partner, or helping a friend that was in the camp. Others like Viktor were able to create more meaning, as a neurologist and psychiatrist, he saw himself comunicating the message of healing through meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of us are so confused because of years of publicity, social standards and other kind of influence, and also so out of touch with our own imagination that it’s very hard to make up this story, to make up this meaning for ourselves. Humans by nature will go by the easiests path: buy someone else’s fictional story. But many times the easiests path is fake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone else’s story is incomplete, it lacks definition, so we start borrowing pieces of other people stories, which conflict with each other, and create huge conflicts in ourselves, leaving our own story and sense of meaning empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some elements that make the sotry more compelling. One is making a responsible story. Being responsible is being free and caring at the same time, as opposed to free and selfish for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build a meaning for yourself, strong enough to endure, it must be about contributing, and while building this meaning the self centereness will slowly go away, allowing a rich life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does a selfcentered software profesional fabricates a story full with meaning? how might he use his acquired skill to contribute? Well this is my journey, this is the story we are living, this is how we are turning the direction of our boat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ernesto Butto</name><email>ernesto@catwizard.io</email></author><category term="story" /><category term="meaning of life" /><category term="lingostand" /><category term="software" /><summary type="html">My search toward growing and contribution &quot;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A thank you letter to the JHipster Team</title><link href="http://blog.catwizard.io/2018/06/09/jhipster-thanks.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A thank you letter to the JHipster Team" /><published>2018-06-09T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-06-09T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://blog.catwizard.io/2018/06/09/jhipster-thanks</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://blog.catwizard.io/2018/06/09/jhipster-thanks.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you letter to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/juliendubois&quot;&gt;Julien Dubois&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/java_hipster&quot;&gt;JHipster Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Ernesto Buttó, I’m Co-Funder with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/laslorma&quot;&gt;Cindy Marin&lt;/a&gt; of a small software company (currently 3 people) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catwizard.io&quot;&gt;catwizard.io&lt;/a&gt;. Cindy recently did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://catwizard.io/workshop.html&quot;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; in Women Tech Makers Barcelona 2018 about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhipster.tech/&quot;&gt;JHipster&lt;/a&gt;, and I wanted to say a few words about how JHipster has impacted our lives and the people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes as a way of thanking the JHipster team for making this platform. I figured that the best way we could do it was telling our story of JHipster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working together for 11 years now. Cindy and I are both originally from Venezuela. We started a software company there that now days is called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catwizard.io&quot;&gt;catwizard.io&lt;/a&gt;  (originally Bambu Soluciones). After getting our degrees in Computer Engineering, we started our professional path as software developers while also starting a company. Being programmers and entrepreneurs. During those early days, we were many, not just Cindy and I. We met our first partner, he had the idea of a building an online product catalog solution for a specific industry and a Content Management System to go with it. He sold us that he could sell it and he would become a supporter and mentor for the startup years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend recomended Spring as the backend, we figured Adobe Flex is the future in the front end… We, young and enthusiastic as we were for anything that sounded fancy and productive, followed. So we coded, we build, we sold. It worked! Kinda…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-about-code-business-and-market&quot;&gt;Learning about Code, Business and Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all growing slowly but surely as we became incrementally better in the technical and business front. We were learning how to be a company rather than a team, how to be profitable, how to manage money and time, while at the same learning how to write better code, how to manage ourselves as programmers. We learned to hire and to teach, we gave and took, and in the process, we met the third team member that has been working with us since then Fatima Pestana, data engineer with a taste for CSS and helping customers to achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like setting up the foundations of a house, sure it was slow, but whatever we were building, it was growing steady and strong. Then Venezuela happened. Economy and personal security levels went in a steep decline. Shortages of basic stuff began (toilet paper, eggs, legumes, milk, etc…) while crime rates went dramatically up. Saddened, we started to think about leaving. What future could we have in these circumstances? Then again: how do you leave behind all that you’ve built for years? How do you leave all your promises to your customers and to yourself? How do you just get on a plane, and… start from scratch? A small decision. To get through a door, to get on a car, to give a final hug, and your habits and definitions and reminders of who you are, in an instant, puff…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our company, however… We did not want stop working together. Our company. It grew into us. It was our dream. It was our vision. It was working, it was giving back. We just couldn’t. And at least about that, of all things, we were able to do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“To run it remotely”, we figured. So we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, easier being said than done, amirite? Our business, our sole business at the moment was this: a set of modules and services that we sold to companies. Our sales strategy was based on trust that we had built, relying on existing customers that wanted new modules, and a support and service-oriented approach that contributed to our reputation spreading mostly by word of mouth. We basically ran most of the time in operations, while prospects and customers called and visited us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Venezuela kept happening. As the country tumbled, many of our customers were forced to close doors, or to stay operating at minimums depending on the industry, size, strategic view of the owners, with a heavy dose of unrelenting optimism, and faith. Lot’s of faith that it will all turn out for the best. Eventually…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what could we do? We can work remotely, ok, but most (not all) of our clients were closing shop, and nobody outside of Venezuela knew us. We figured that we could work on custom developments and consulting, primarily to costumers in the USA that we already had bonds with. Strengthen our relationships, you know. Improve our delivery times and features compliance, become competitive, while not forgetting about those in Venezuela that still relied upon us and somehow managed to stay afloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-nomads-vs-giving-up&quot;&gt;Digital Nomads vs Giving Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After living on the road for a few months, while being a consulting company and traveling to several countries (living the remote life, hooray!), including Colombia, Peru, Chile, Sicily, we decided to settle ourselves for a while in warm, sunny Spain, in a small city close to Barcelona called Girona. It was working great! We had challenges but we had freedom, we had stress but also relief. Responsibilities but also a taste of peace of mind, and less loud worries about politics or tragically, toilet paper (and I do mean less loud …family and friends are still there). We had left our home, but we were finally feeling like were building a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately after taking our first breath in our first Spanish flat, we were thrown into a very stressful situation. We accepted a project that was going to affect a core process of our main customers in the USA while a new opportunity involving a mobile app connecting via Bluetooth to an electric skateboard arose (stoked!).  We had very little time, and a very limited budget to handle it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our client’s business software touched many areas. It required security and reliability to handle everyday operations, it integrated SalesForce to their products marketing information system and to their accounting systems. We loved the project, but the resources and time frames were very short for such a software to be built from sratch. I could feel the risk of finishing the project and beraly being able to pay our bills, and in any other circumstances, we probably would not have agreed to do it, but by this time we have no other source of income and zero contacts in Spain. Nobody knew us, and we didn’t know how to market ourselves here. And on the other side there were the skateboard guys. New client, young guys with a revolutionary product at hand, with lots of promise and potential and interesting technologies… No much money upfront but if the project launched and worked then it would also make sense in the buisiness side… And it seemed so much fun!  We just couldn’t say no to that. What if this became the floating skateboard we are all waiting for? Our future selves would’ve never forgiven us. But no time, no money. What can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-jhipster&quot;&gt;Enter JHipster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, 2 days after agreeing to the project with our USA client we were feeling like we were already falling behind. Very anxious and all that. We remembered that we had tried JHipster some years back, while fooling around on the Internet. I went and looked at it again and was amazed on everything the team had built around the generator. The JDL language, the ease of use of the development workflow, the generated security, the roles! The user’s administration, swagger integration, the monitors, the logging, the profiles, java testing, frontend testing, the sonar integration, performance tests, integration tests… I mean… all the options, man! Once I got a hold of the workflow using GitHub and all the tools JHipster provided I felt like Mickey in the Fantasia movie, the Wizard Mickey discovering that he has this magic, that he he owns it, and that he can create universes and life! We were suddenly able to learn and apply a lot of technologies and concepts that we simply could not afford in the past. There was a way of updating the entities fields and relationships, exporting the model. The production profile is so well packaged, the cache options, the database options, do you need realtime with websockets ? ultra fast Elasticsearch engine ? internationalization ? got it choose the languages… we included ng-prime and solved specific user interface requirements (Now days there is a module for that in the marketplace), and the Angular2 was almost out of Beta (They support Angular 5 now and React). I mean I was so excited of all the tech behind it and at all it could do for our customers, all it could do for us! Well… Fast forward some months and we are now delivering the project built in JHipster, approved for production (replacing a very old legacy lotus notes workflow, allowing collaboration between the users, monitoring, delivering branded PDF’s, creating tasks on the CRM etc…) and with a very happy client. We delivered on time and turned a profit thanks to the hours we saved. Even more, some other module, one that was approved after all of this and wasn’t even part of the original scope of the project, we were able to include it before hand. We had anticipated and we delivered! We were skipping through time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jhip1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jhipster Generator Example Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that we were able to pay for the migration costs, find a better place to live, get our legal papers in order. That first breath of our new flat came again, and this time we managed to fully enjoy it. Ecstatic relief. Good news appeared: our client in the USA told us that their solution was used steadily in daily operations. We became able to help our partner in Venezuela (Fatima Pestana) dealing with the, by now, devastating economic crisis. We were helping family and friends leave the country. Thanks to JHipster we became again to not only be sustainable as a company but also to able to give back. To connect with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cindy came up with the idea of a JHipster workshop for the Women Tech Makers in Barcelona. It would not only show the many technical benefits of JHipster but it could also be purposed as a tool for empowerment. It turned out to be (at the time of this writing) the most viewed video of all the talks (&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/SoxR30Kkwj4&quot;&gt;you can check it out here&lt;/a&gt;). That same workshop inspired me to help in the next Software Craft Barcelona 2018 event and help Cindy to boost a GDG initiative at Girona. Spreading the word, be it via a workshop, or a long article in a small blog seems like the least we could do to say thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of generated update entity view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jhip2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of generated update entity view&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jhipster-boosts-learning&quot;&gt;JHipster boosts learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn you shall want and to learn you shall do! There’s so much to learn from JHipster. I mean… Let’s start with the code. The quality of the generated code (AAA in sonarqube currently!) is the result of well-thought concepts and solutions aimed at a very specific set of problems. What JHipster does, it does it well. Considering how easy it is to get confused in this world about best practices, best methodology, best strategies, best this, best that… There is a huge benefit of seeing those best bests in a tangible product, functioning in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small example in the Spring part: the service layer… Should I build a service layer for every endpoint, or can I get away with calling the repository directly? How should we deal with that kind of thing…? Ok, how does JHipster generates all those abstraction layers and why? Now, as responsible programmers, we go and read the documentation, test it with some cases, and very quickly arrive at our own conclusions. Because behind the tools there are philosophies and concepts that support the results, and because you provide several options regarding a particular practice, we can compare, we can experiment and tinker, we can be playful! (and everybody knows the importance of play)… Oh! yes let’s use service class in this case, interface in that case, but mostly let’s just call the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example swagger integration, out of the box JSON API interactive interface sandbox!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jhip3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jhipster Generator Example Image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can recommend 100% JHipster to anyone who is on the path of learning about Java + Angular/React/Ionic , or about architectures, or about microservices, or about Spring security, or about DevOps (because the profiles, CI tools, deployment and docker stuff is awesome!), or about data modeling, or comparing paradigms like NoSQL vs SQL, or about multilanguage architecture, etc…If you’re reading this and are still not sure, I say: Yes, go through books and online courses and MOOCs and whatnot, but—as it is with anything worthy in this life—, I encourage you to get your hands dirty, as anything worthy in this life requires… Now, if you decided that yes, that you do want to get to the depths of some tech, to see it as it is and understand what it does, how it does it and what it really has to offer, not necessarily become an expert but really knowledgeable… I mean, if you really want to get your hands dirty, why not do it with some really really good mud? This is the algorithm: create a simple project with JHipster, see what it does, add a technology you would like to understand, see what it does now, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I was learning and implementing docker, and we have a real use case of a company that has two monolith applications that work together communicating through their JSON API’s. I wasn’t sure if this was right, or common or if there are ways of packaging them. Came again JHipster. In the Docker section of the documentation I found this gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If your architecture is composed of several JHipster applications, you can use &amp;gt; the specific docker-compose sub-generator, which will generate a global Docker &amp;gt; Compose configuration for all selected applications…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooohh!! So it’s ok! It’s OK. They don’t have to be microservices to connect. And look at the docker-compose files! Certainly, we can start from here…!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jhipster-changed-the-game-for-us&quot;&gt;JHipster changed the game for us&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point, you must know that every technology in JHipster has a reason to be. It is useful by itself, yes, but it can be even more if combined with another one. To successfully implement these combinations (JWT Spring security + Angular for example, or ElasticSearch… or Social, etc..) by yourself is not trivial. Lot’s of trial and error, lot’s of mistakes, maybe even some expensive ones If you want to learn about it you need a lot of time, and budgets of SMBs project won’t cover for these researchers. JHipster provides a way. A low-cost way of learning not how to be a developer but how to be a good one. Not only using Spring in blind-following-the-blind fashion like when we were starting in Venezuela, but using it well; and that along Elasticsearch, and Docker, and Swagger and a myriad of other outstanding packages…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of generated monitor screen&lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jhip4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jhipster Generator Monitor Screen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, JHipster was a fundamental solution during a very hard time of our lives, and it is now a fundamental part of our learning, our processes as developers and our processes as service providers. What else can I say but thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ernesto Butto</name><email>ernesto@catwizard.io</email></author><category term="story" /><summary type="html">How this amazing opensource project impacted our lives</summary></entry></feed>
